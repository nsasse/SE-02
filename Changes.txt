Added the start of a compiler for full ICWS94 w/ pmars extensions.

Added addConstant(String, String) to the assembler interface so predefined
equates can be set.

Added parseWarrior(InputStream) to the assembler interface so multiple 
warriors can be parsed with one instance.

Created VM interface.

Moved repaint command into frontend components, this fixed the problem with
the CoreDisplay in jdk 1.3.0 not refreshing properly. It did cause about a 25%
slow down though.

Moved Memory class to corewars.jmars package.

Created Assembler interface and renamed old assembler to Simple.

Moved WarriorObj class from marsVM package to corewars.jmars.

Assembler now correctly sets default modifier.

0.01 -> 0.02
Added a Memory.equals(Object) method so it will correctly handle the case where
it is called with a Memory object that is referenced by an Object reference (is
that confusing enough). Carter Cheng pointed out the need for this. Thanks 
Carter.

Added several new interfaces to the frontend changing interaction with it to an
event style interface. This provides alot more flexibility but caused a huge
slow down so I may abandon it in the future if it doesn't provide enough of an 
advantage.

Changed the StatReport class to StepReport and all classes that referenced it, 
moved to the frontend package.

Changed the CoreDisplay to implement the new StepListener interface.

Added the RoundCycleCounter class.

0.0 -> 0.01
Cleaned up code to a common style in all packages except for assembler (plan on 
completely replacing it in a future release)

Added javadoc comments to all classes and functions

Changed the round/cycle indicator to a label
