These are the overall goals I have for jMARS.

Provide a nice GUI application for people to run and debug their warriors in.
Provide an applet that can be used to run warriors on the WWW.
Provide an easy framework for people to experiment with extensions to redcode.
Provide a base that people can easily adapt for use with GA or other means of computer generated warriors.
